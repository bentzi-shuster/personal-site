### Overview

This was a fun project that I made in one of the first web development classes that I took at NJIT.
Not only did it spark my interest in web development, but it also gave me a chance to learn about scaling and security.

### Features

- Randomly generated taglines
- Admin panel for adding users, products, and categories
- User authentication with hashed passwords
- Shopping cart and checkout system (no payment processing)

### Conclusion

This project was a great learning experience and just a fun project to work on.
I learned that class projects are a lot more fun when you can make them funny and not take them too seriously.
I also learned a lot about the importance of security - and did some things like setting up a .htaccess file to protect my .env file (looking back I don't know why I didn't just put the .env file outside of the web root).
