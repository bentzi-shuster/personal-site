### The previous work

The Schedule Builder UI Revamp was the first of the full blown schedule builder UIs.
It had a lot of features that I was proud of, but after a few months of not working on the project, I came back to it and realized that I had no idea what was going on, and the codebase was a mess.
Thats when the second _UI Revamp_ was started.

### Major changes from the first UI

For this new version of the schedule builder, I knew from the start that scope creep was going to be a big issue.
Thats why I decided to start with a list of features that I wanted to have in the new version, and then I would only add features that were on that list.
This included things like:

- A better search feature
- Mobile responsiveness
- Plans
- Exporting

### Outcomes

While less impressive then the first UI revamp, the second UI revamp was a big step forward in terms of code quality and maintainability.
