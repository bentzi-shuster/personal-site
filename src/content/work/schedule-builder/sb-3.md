### Background

Having worked on the schedule builders for most of my time at NJIT, I was able to gain a lot of insight into how the schedule builder worked.
In my junior year, I found out that a small group of students under the ACM club on campus were working on starting a project to revamp the schedule builder and teach students how to develop web applications.
Without hesitation, I joined the project and became one of the lead developers and the "go-to" person for the frontend development.
This version of the schedule builder has a lot less restrictions than the past versions that were built off of the existing schedule builder backend.
This version had a new backend that was built from scratch with data being pulled from the NJIT course catalog and course schedule - this allowed us to have a lot more control over the data and how it was displayed.
One of the major limitations is that the data is not live - but that isn't getting in the way of the development of the project... just a nice to have.
