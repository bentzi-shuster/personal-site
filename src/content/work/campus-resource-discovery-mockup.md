### Overview

This was my first introduction to UX design and I had a lot of fun with it.
My group worked together to create a campus resource discovery app that would help students find resources available to them on campus.

All aspects of the design were intentional - with choices like the design system, color scheme, and typography all being chosen to help the user recognize the app as a resource for NJIT students.

### Features

- Full campus map with clickable buildings
- Dynamic cards that display information about the authenticated user
- a search bar that allows users to search for resources by name or category
- Settings page that allows users to change their preferences
