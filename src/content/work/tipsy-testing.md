### Overview

The story behind this project is a bit of a funny one.
I was in a 100 level web development class and we were tasked with making a website that used Bootstrap.
The instructions were pretty open-ended, but the professor did say if we make him dizzy or nauseous we would lose points ..... and I had points to spare.

### Features

This site has a lot of animations and fun little things to play with!!! Some of the effects include:

- A subtle blur on the whole page
- Animated cursor trail
- flying bees on a predefined SVG path
- Hovering over the logo makes it shake
- the ::selection pseudo-element is styled to be a mix of magenta, lime, and cyan
- each page has a unique transition effect (my favorite is the "Alternatives for under 21" pages batman transition)
- "party squirrel" that runs across the screen when you hover over it makes the page shake and dance around
- clicking and holding on page for 100 seconds makes the page get "angry"
- so much more!!!

The sites content is made with ChatGPT (much better then lorem ipsum IMHO), but it took a bit of prompting to get it to generate the content I wanted. I ended up using the prompt "Write a website about taking exams while under the influence of water" and then replacing the word "water" with "alcohol" in the generated text.

### Conclusion

While I love this project, I do realize that there are some things that I could have done better.
First, I wish I was a bit more descriptive with the repo name - I named it `FinalProject` which is not very descriptive.
While I can re-name the repo, I don't want to break the links that I have to it.
Second, I wish I used the CSS `@media` rule to check if the user has `prefers-reduced-motion` set to `reduce` and then disable the animations.
I did make a whole version of the site that has reduced animations, but I wish I had done it in a way that is more accessible and user-friendly.
Overall, I am happy with the project and I think it is a fun little thing to show off and a great way to start a conversation.
